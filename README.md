## Background
The Storyclock is based off of a visual of a time-dependent story where you can fill in gaps in a story or notice symmetries in a story. It is inspired by the Storyclock notebook by [Plot Devices](https://plotdevices.co/). To learn more about the Storyclock Process, check out the creator of the Storyclock Notebook, Seth Worley's, explanation: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9viuUvC4f0).

## How to Use
Here is an example input for creating a Storyclock:
The first line is the full runtime of your story, in this example a Storyclock for the film _The Prestige_. You can just look up your film's runtime and paste it in the HH:MM:SS format.

Then while you're watching or listening to your story, type in the timestamp of what happened in the HH:MM:SS format, as shown in the example below:

Then the clock will show up like so when you focus away from the text as with many Obsidian plugins. You can select the `</>` icon in the top right to switch back to editing the Storyclock.
